## Introduction

This project aims to develop a real-time object detection and tracking system utilizing Wireless Camera Networks (WCN). The system can identify and follow objects in a video feed, which is essential for various applications like surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and smart environments.

## Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: Leverages deep learning models to identify objects in video frames instantly.
- **Object Tracking**: Employs advanced tracking algorithms to maintain consistent identification of moving objects.
- **Wireless Communication Integration**: Utilizes WCN for seamless data transmission and system scalability.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for real-time monitoring and analysis.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle multiple objects and extensive environments efficiently.

## Installation

To install and run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   gh repo clone AryaSaurabh09/Real-Time-Object-Detection-and-Tracking-
   cd Real-Time-Object-Detection-and-Tracking-
   ```

2. **Install the necessary dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the pre-trained models**:
   Ensure you have the necessary pre-trained models for object detection. You can download them from the following link:
   - [Model Download Link](#)

4. **Configure the settings**:
   Update the `config.yaml` file with your system's specifications and preferences.

## Usage

You can run the model for different sources using the following commands:

### For Video File
```sh
python yolo\v8\detect\detect_and_trk.py model=yolov8s.pt source="test.mp4" show=True
```

### For Image File
```sh
python yolo\v8\detect\detect_and_trk.py model=yolov8m.pt source="path_to_image"
```

### For Webcam
```sh
python yolo\v8\detect\detect_and_trk.py model=yolov8m.pt source=0 show=True
```

### For External Camera
```sh
python yolo\v8\detect\detect_and_trk.py model=yolov8m.pt source=1 show=True
```

You can customize the parameters and settings in the `config.yaml` file as per your requirements.
